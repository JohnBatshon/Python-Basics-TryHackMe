# Operator          | Syntax    | Example
# Addition          | +         | 1 + 1 = 2
# Subtraction       | -         | 5 - 1 = 4
# Multiplication    | *         | 10 * 10 = 100
# Division          | /         | 10 / 2 = 5
# Modulus           | %         | 10 % 2 = 0
# Exponent          | **        | 5**2 = 25(5 to the 2nd Power)
